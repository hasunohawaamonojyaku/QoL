# QoL
QoL (quality of life), are you tired of doing things without optimisation? Researching 5 hour just to trash the project? Well I can't help with that but I can make it a better.
## Overview

QoL Keyword Highlighter is a userscript that enhances your browsing experience by automatically highlighting specific keywords on any webpage. Tired of manually searching through text and wasting hours on research? This script is here to streamline your workflow and boost your quality of life (QoL) by making important terms stand out immediately.

## Features

- **Automatic Highlighting:**  
  Automatically finds and highlights predefined keywords in all `<p>` elements across any website.

- **Dynamic Matching:**  
  Uses regular expressions to detect various forms of the keywords (e.g., "bee" vs. "bees").

- **Real-time Analytics:**  
  Logs detailed statistics to the console, including the number of matches and text lengths.

- **Cross-Site Functionality:**  
  Works on every site thanks to the universal `@match *://*/*` directive.
